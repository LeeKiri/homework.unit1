HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


In this assignment I made the following changes to the html doc to refactor the file in alighnment with the acceptance criteria.



1- I structured the html in a way that was easier to read by formatting each line with indents appropriately according to their order. Placed the paragraph content inside the p tags.

2- I added an ID to the 'search engine optimization' section to correct the link that was not working.

3- I added the following tags to follow semantic HTML structuring; `<nav> <section> <aside> <header> <footer> <title>`

4- I added alt tags to all images to ensure the website is accessible.

5- I changed the title from 'Website' to the company name. 

6- I changed the h2 element in the footer to h4 so they fall in sequential order and updated the CSS deleting the h2 font-size. 

7- I added an aria-label to the hero image in the html file to act as an alt tag for this image.
